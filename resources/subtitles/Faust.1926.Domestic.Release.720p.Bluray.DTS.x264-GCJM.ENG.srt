Cast:

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,529
Behold:

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,204
The portals of darkness are open

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,968
and the shadows of the dead
hunt over the Earth...

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,286
Back! Hold! Why dost thou
scourge mankind

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,371
with war, plague, famine?!

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,241
The Earth is mine!

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,405
Never will the Earth be thine!

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,650
Man is good: he strives for Truth!

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,211
Look below!

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,686
All things in heaven and on Earth

19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,406
are wonderful!

20
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,842
But the greatest wonder

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,688
is man's freedom to choose

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,168
between good and evil!

23
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,326
Dost thou know Faust?!

24
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,051
A knave like all others!

25
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,209
He preaches good and does evil!

26
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,325
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!

27
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,250
Behold his greed!

28
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,131
A wager:

29
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,122
I will wrest Faust's soul away from God!

30
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,168
If thou canst destroy

31
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,602
what is divine in Faust,

32
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,609
the Earth is thine!

33
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,961
No man can resist evil!

34
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,129
The bet is on!!

35
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,768
The Plague!...The Plague!

36
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,324
The devastating epidemic raged:

37
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,610
within a few clays half the town lay dying!

38
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,924
To find a cure for the plague

39
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,771
Faust spent clay and night

40
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,247
in prayer with God.

41
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,366
...and a great shriek

42
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,847
rose from Egypt,

43
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,327
for there was not a house

44
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,249
without its dead

45
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,126
Lord God,

46
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,727
bless this act of redemption!

47
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,606
Only you can alleviate our misery!

48
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,251
Help...help! My mother is dying!

49
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:37,322
Mortal terror and fear of death
swept through the town...

50
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,081
Repent, fast and pray!

51
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,762
Only faith can vanquish death!

52
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,931
Show respect for the dead!

53
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,166
We still live. We still love!

54
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,127
We shall die dancing
in each other's arms!

55
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,531
Who has faith shall live!

56
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,810
But death will take the sinners!

57
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,681
The Plague!! The Plague!!

58
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,606
Compassion, Faust!

59
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,927
Only you can help us!!

60
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,402
Get away from me! We are lost!

61
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,127
Neither faith nor knowledge is any help!

62
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,322
Everything is a lie...

63
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,561
My Lord, thou art merciful

64
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,241
and a great goodness

65
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,445
The third great key

66
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,363
to the force of the ghost of hell

67
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,044
And if thou would summon

68
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,766
the Prince of Darkness
to aid thee and give thee

69
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,406
all the might and glory
of the world

70
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,765
go to a crossroad

71
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,841
and call on him three times...

72
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,729
I invoke thy aid, Spirit of Darkness:

73
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,362
show thyself!

74
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,009
Come forth, demon of evil!

75
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,727
As thou art called

76
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,123
with thy unholy name:

77
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,483
MEPHISTO appear!

78
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,722
You have summoned me!

79
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,882
Here I am!

80
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,001
I renounce God
and his heavenly legion

81
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,321
and so all the power and glory

82
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,522
of the world

83
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,126
shall be mine

84
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,888
Be gone from me, Satan!

85
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,248
To have the power to help
for just one day!

86
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,410
One clay! Try it!

87
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,450
Just one trial clay!

88
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,642
When the sand runs out...

89
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,482
...you will be free,

90
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,242
the pact cancelled! Sign!

91
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,522
GLORY

92
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,684
POWER

93
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,243
Can you help the hungry and the sick?

94
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,810
What you wish, I will perform:

95
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,651
You are the master,

96
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,321
and I am your servant!

97
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,167
A drop of blood!

98
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,569
Blood is quite
a remarkable substance!

99
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,842
For one clay only - ?!

100
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,362
Until the sand has run out!

101
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,647
Faust! Help us!!

102
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,922
Then I shall help
in the devil's name!

103
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,371
A miracle! A miracle!

104
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,447
In the name of Christ crucified,

105
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,087
help my child!

106
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,567
He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!

107
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,602
He is in league with the devil!

108
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,486
Stone him! Stone him!!

109
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,842
Deliver me, elixir of death!

110
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,762
You cannot cheat me!

111
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,362
Remember our pact!

112
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,563
The trial clay is not over yet!

113
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,807
Death sets all men free!

114
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,163
Is that death?

115
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,921
It is life, Faust, seducing you

116
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,123
with the fair image of your youth!

117
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,802
Wretched Faust,

118
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,049
why do you seek death:

119
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,522
You have not yet lived!

120
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,648
I despise my life!

121
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,888
Your life was only the dust

122
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,287
and mould of books!

123
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,006
Pleasure is everything!

124
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,161
I am too old!

125
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,850
I offer you the greatest happiness:

126
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,123
Youth!

127
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,561
Seize it!

128
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,922
Give me youth!!!

129
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,250
I've caught you, old boy!

130
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,882
Take me...to her!

131
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,328
Step upon my cloak...

132
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,043
...and the spinning Earth
will spread before you!

133
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,640
The wedding feast

134
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,684
for the Duchess of Parma:

135
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,561
the most beautiful woman in Italy!

136
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,567
Strange guests!

137
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,006
To pay tribute to the highest beauty,

138
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,249
my lord brings you

139
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,603
his kingdom's treasures!

140
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,571
The trial clay is over!
The sand has run out!

141
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,651
Be as you were!

142
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,371
Youth... leave me my youth!!

143
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,080
I am enslaved for eternity!

144
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,042
Faust, you have tasted

145
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,522
all of life's pleasures!

146
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,922
From indulgence to indulgence...

147
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,402
sensation without end!

148
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,888
Yet nothing satisfied you!

149
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,962
What do you want?

150
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,165
A woman, a game of chance, an orgy?

151
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,205
Whatever you wish, I must grant!

152
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,122
Do you want the emperor's crown?!

153
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,247
Home!

154
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,682
Take me home! At once!

155
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,567
Is today a feast clay in your town?

156
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,284
Are you heathen born

157
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,483
that you have never heard

158
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,649
of Holy Easter?!

159
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,247
It is as if life had stood still:

160
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,327
All is as it once was...!

161
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,530
An innocent little girl runs to a priest...

162
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,440
She is not for you...!

163
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,446
Praise the Lord

164
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,009
the mighty king of honour...

165
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,768
Holiday, Mother!

166
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,689
I know more obliging wenches
for you here!

167
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,889
I only want her! Do as I command!

168
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,527
Brother Valentin!

169
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,167
Once this little golden chain

170
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,362
is in the house,

171
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,642
she will begin to feel

172
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,331
the devil's power!

173
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,002
Good gracious, how pretty you are!

174
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,488
Any lovers yet?

175
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,447
What do you have there, child?

176
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,330
Tell her, my child,

177
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,082
if you don't want to tell me!

178
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,647
May I visit Aunt Marthe?

179
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,802
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein

180
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,564
Three little drops from this love potion

181
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,687
and all the girls' hearts will be yours!

182
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,849
Aunt Marthe, look what I found
in my drawer...!

183
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,722
A rich treasure!

184
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,607
I found it in my drawer!

185
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,723
Let me try on this
beautiful necklace just the once!

186
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,770
A small bouquet for the bridegroom,

187
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,645
a little wreath for the bride...

188
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,643
Excuse me, lovely lady,
I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!

189
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,643
From your cousin...
from Lombardy...!

190
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,209
He gave me this necklace
as a gift for you!

191
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,607
Those we encircle within this ring,

192
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,122
shall be sweethearts...!

193
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,167
One, two, three, makes you free...!

194
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,441
Pardon: my stomach is too weak
for such a fiery drink!

195
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:05,326
Allow me to mix myself a little drink,

196
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,889
that I learned to make in Padua!

197
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:41,922
My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!

198
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,002
<i>He loves me...</i>

199
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,607
<i>...he</i> loves <i>me not...</i>

200
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,764
<i>...he</i> loves <i>me...</i>

201
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:35,321
Yes, with all his heart
he loves you!

202
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,687
She loves <i>me...</i>

203
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,841
<i>...she</i> loves <i>me not...</i>

204
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,162
She loves you!

205
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,886
I am yours forever!

206
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,482
He loves me...!

207
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,087
What are you waiting for!?

208
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,603
Your sweetheart lights the way for you...!

209
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,081
Cursed matchmaker!

210
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,607
I will keep the brother
out of the way!

211
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:17,849
To the prettiest girl in town!

212
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,886
No other girl is as pretty as your sister:

213
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,449
Long live Gretchen!

214
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,648
A pretty girl is not pure!

215
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,207
Here's to Gretchen!

216
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,928
Here's to your Gretchen!

217
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,850
If you hurry,
you can catch her lover

218
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,806
before he slips out of her room!

219
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:15,403
<i>Flee... flee...
You have murdered</i> him!

220
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,122
Murder!

221
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,322
Murder...Murder...!!

222
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:54,249
Murder...Murder...Murder...!!

223
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,208
Flee!...Flee!!

224
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,006
The deputies are already seeking
the murderer!

225
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,201
Don't touch me, you wench!

226
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,722
Your lover has slain me!

227
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,371
Read me my requiem mass first!

228
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,565
Then: take this harlot to the stocks!

229
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:23,043
Gretchen...Gretchen...!

230
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,240
Now death and nature with surprise,

231
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,206
behold the trembling sinners rise

232
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:04,120
to meet the judge's searching eyes...

233
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:17,770
For now before the judge

234
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,930
no crime can pass unpunished here...

235
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:27,808
All hidden things must appear plain!

236
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,131
Mother...Mother!

237
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,246
And a little child has been born,

238
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,489
in the depth of winter...

239
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:09,848
Have mercy on my child!

240
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,722
Aren't you Gretchen,
who stood in the stocks?!

241
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,122
Mercy! Mercy! My child is dying!

242
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,649
She has killed her child!

243
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,169
Seize her, the murderess!

244
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:40,328
Faust...Faust...help your Gretchen !!

245
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,567
Mephisto!

246
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,691
You have betrayed me!

247
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,849
She suffers...she suffers!!

248
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:17,243
To the stake
with the child murderer!

249
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,882
Save her, save Gretchen!!

250
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:41,842
Too late! They're already building
her funeral pyre!

251
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,567
You are still my servant!

252
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:52,129
Take me to her, or the pact is broken!

253
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,281
My steed awaits!

254
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:03,007
Quick, before morning comes!

255
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,282
Faster...faster!!

256
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:17,681
Oh, had I never wished for youth

257
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:22,926
that brought this misery!

258
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:27,011
Curse...curse the delusion of youth!

259
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:52,245
You have yourself cursed youth!

260
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:57,685
What you wish, I must grant!

261
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:44,048
Be as you were: an old man!!

262
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:02,722
Forgive...forgive me my sin!

263
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,886
Gretchen...!

264
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:05,728
Here is no place for thee!

265
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,887
I claim my wager!

266
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,803
One word breaks thy pact!

267
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,245
What is the word?

268
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,241
The word that wings joyfully

269
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,806
throughout the universe,

270
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,207
the word that appeases

271
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,687
every pain and grief,

272
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,167
the word that expiates

273
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,647
all human guilt,

274
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,127
the eternal word,

275
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,050
dost thou not know it?!

276
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:55,205
What is the word?

277
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:10,007
LOVE
